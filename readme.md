* PopQuiz

* Gradients
  * We reviewed the syntax for `background-image: linear-gradient()`
    * `simple.html` is the first part
    * `index.html` and `style.css` are for the exercise where we had to create flags
      * **Try to create recreate the last 3 flags without looking at the code**
  * :file_folder: [`03_gradients`](https://github.com/stribis/html_css_wdd320/tree/master/week_03/03_gradients)
