<!-- 
  Browsers have default styles for when they load an HTML document up.
  This means that even if you don't have any CSS, your browser will style certain elements using their default rules.
  As a web designer you want to prevent this, since you want to be able to define YOUR OWN styles.

  We use reset styles to prevent this
  
  A very minimal reset style would be to just set margin and padding back to 0.
  Example:
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding 0;
  }

  But you can also reset other properties if you want.

  Here are a couple of popular CSS resets;
  Eric Meyer web Reset: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
  HTML5 Doctor CSS Reset: http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/
  Russ Weakly CSS Reset: http://maxdesign.com.au/articles/css-reset/

  You can also use a CSS reset library such as
  Normalize CSS : https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

  Or you could also build your own!
